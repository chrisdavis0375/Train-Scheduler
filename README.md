# Train-Scheduler

*What this app does

-This app allows the user to manage train schedules by being able to view train names, frequencies, arrival times, and destinations. All train data is stored in a realtime firebase database and then returned and appended to the table, then based on the ETA, momentjs will calculate how minutes away the train is from arriving.

*How its useful

-This scheduler is useful to keep track of when trains are going to arrive and to keep an organized table of all listed trains.

*How to add another train

-In the input fields at the bottom of the page the user must input the new trains name, destination, frequency, and estimated time of arrival. After clicking submit the train will be stored in firebase and appended to the table to see.
